## About YFRL

YF Robotics Laboratory (YFRL) is an independent, international and inclusive robotics interest group. YFRL was founded with the vision that robots will contribute to human society and largely affect the way how people would live in the near future. Our mission is to promote robotics projects and education, and to bring ideas from professionals to the public with state-of-the-art robotic research and technologies across the world.

We are a small special interest group of people from worldwide who love robots. We aim to bring together robot researchers, developers and enthusiasts to build a world with more intelligent, reliable and safer autonomous robots. We are specially interested to create cross-domain robotics-related projects, to make robots social friendly, and to make people thinking how to live harmony with robots.

Please help us by telling us which robot activities you are involved in and what possibly you could do together with us by sending an email to yfrobotics@gmail.com.
